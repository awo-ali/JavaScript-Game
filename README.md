# JavaScript-Game
For my week-3 challenge, on the nology software engineering course, I attempted to build 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' online game. I accomplished this using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Weâ€™re aiming for the following goals for this project:

1. A working Game: The main task is to create a Game not only will this test your 
understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem. 
2. Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible 
using git, GitHub and the command line. (We are upping the stakes... 25 commits)
3. Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been 
learning on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, 
use SCSS, BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!
4. Implement a mobile first approach.
